UGTformer is a graph transformer-based model for drug metabolism prediction, capable of simultaneously performing molecular-level substrate classification and atom-level site of metabolism (SOM) prediction. Self-supervised pretraining on the ZINC15 compound library significantly enhances its predictive performance on both tasks, making it a practical tool for early-stage drug metabolism modeling and risk assessment.
